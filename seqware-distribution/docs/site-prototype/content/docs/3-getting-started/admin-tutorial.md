The majority of this guide is dedicated to walking users and developers through the basics of using SeqWare. We assume that people are most interested in the Pipeline sub-project and focus most of our time on that.  The examples below will all be based on a local VM but the environment on our cloud instance is almost identical.

## By the End of These Tutorials

By the end of these tutorials you will:

* create studies, experiments, and samples in the MetaDB
* run a HelloWorld workflow in Pipeline
* create a new workflow bundle in Pipeline
* install and schedule your new workflow bundle in Pipeline and MetaDB
* generate a report on the outputs of your workflows in Pipeline and Portal
* get an overview of the administration process for SeqWare
* be prepared to move on to more detailed documentation for each sub-project

Please launch your local VM and log in as <kbd>seqware</kbd> at this time.
