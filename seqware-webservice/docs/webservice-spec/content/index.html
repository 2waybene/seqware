The SeqWare RESTful Web Service
-------------------------------

This API describes the resources that make up the SeqWare RESTful Web service. 

The SeqWare Web service has two primary functions. First, it is the primary mechanism by which users can query the SeqWare MetaDB. The Web service prevents the user from having to make SQL queries and facilitates building services on top of the MetaDB. Secondly, it allows privileged users to launch and monitor next-generation sequencing workflows and pipelines remotely without having any local SeqWare dependencies. These two functions are split into 'Metadata' and 'Pipeline' functions.
